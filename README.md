-  DenseBox Baidu
        a) single fully convolutional
        b) uses locaitons and scales of an image 
        c) public dataset(MALF, KITTI)
        b) careful hard negative mining techniques
        
-  R-CNN
        a) regional proposal methods to generate all the potential 
           bounding box canadidates
        b) CNN distinguish objects for every proposal 
        c) can't distiguish car from far away
   
-  Yolo
        a) predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities 
           directly from full images in one evaluation
 

What is negative mining techniques?
What is upsampleing?
